# PaperMario

This app showcases a variety of programming concepts and skills and should be given the most attention out of all repositories when perusing this GitHub.

This app is a replica of the video game Paper Mario's turn-based battle system, built using Windows Forms, Visual C#, .NET, SQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Also included is a database mini-app, functioning as a searchable and organizable logbook of enemies, called the Tattle Log. The same database used for the in-game Tattle function is also used to fetch and display the data for the Tattle Log mini-app.

Additional instructions are included in the app while playing the Main Game. Note the textbox at the bottom of the main form that prompts the user for how to interact with the app and continue through various steps of the turn-based battle system.
